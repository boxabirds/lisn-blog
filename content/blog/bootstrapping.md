As a technologist it's rather embarrassing to share that I've never released a mobile app of my own. 

I imagine in some circles there'd be call for some kind of technical _harakiri_ but in my case it's 100% excitement. 

* **I avoided Objective C**. Thank christ for that. I'd rather poke forks in my legs. 
* Finally it seems that **there are some vaguely serviceable iOS + Android cross-platform frameworks**. I know "go native" is best, but frankly I'm lazy and don't want to have to learn two new languages and frameworks (Swift+ iOS and Kotlin + Android specifically). Don't get me wrong, Swift is beautiful, but still, I'm looking to find ways to eke out every productive second I have, and have waited until these frameworks look decent. 

I'm testing out this stack:

* **Google Flutter** (beta, so I have web access) that uses Dart. 
* **AWS**. I'm going to see whether I can convince AWS Lambda to behave because I have Â£0 budget (that's $0 for US viewers). 

This combination isn't very well-supported: while AWS supports Dart in Lambda functions now (as of Feb 2020), all this seems to do is make it even harder to find Dart client libraries for AWS.
