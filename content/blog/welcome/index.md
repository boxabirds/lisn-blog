20 years ago I created my first blog on weblogs.com. Since then I've moved around all over the place, but
the common issue has been proprietary content lock-in. 

I'm hoping by using open source tools liks Gatsby, with markdown format under the hood,
that I'll avoid this in future. 

This blog is about Lisn: knowledge through listening.  

More to come!
